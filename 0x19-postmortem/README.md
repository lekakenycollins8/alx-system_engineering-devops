# Outage Postmortem: When the Code Hit the Fan

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** May 14, 2024, 15:00 UTC to May 15, 2024, 02:00 UTC
- **Impact:** The core service API experienced intermittent downtime, resulting in 60% of users being unable to access critical features. Users reported slow response times, timeouts, and failed transactions.
- **Root Cause:** A rogue squirrel chewed through the fiber optic cable connecting our data center to the internet, disrupting network connectivity.

## Timeline:
- **May 14, 2024, 15:00 UTC:** Issue detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden increase in error rates.
- **15:05 UTC:** Engineer notices unusual network activity and initiates investigation.
- **15:30 UTC:** Initial assumption: Database overload due to increased traffic. Investigation begins on database performance metrics.
- **16:00 UTC:** Realize database is not the bottleneck. Attention shifts to network infrastructure.
- **17:30 UTC:** Misleading investigation: Suspect DDoS attack due to unusual traffic patterns. Engage security team for further analysis.
- **18:30 UTC:** Escalate incident to network operations team as suspicions of network issues grow.
- **20:00 UTC:** Confirmed: Fiber optic cable severed by a squirrel. Begin emergency repair procedures.
- **May 15, 2024, 02:00 UTC:** Connectivity restored, service fully operational.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** A furry critter with a taste for adventure chewed through our internet lifeline, disrupting network connectivity to our data center.
- **Resolution:** Network operations team repaired the damaged cable and implemented protective measures to prevent future squirrel-related incidents, including installing critter-proof casing and enhancing monitoring for early detection.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Strengthen network redundancy to minimize single points of failure.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to detect physical infrastructure issues promptly.
  - Develop emergency response protocols for unforeseen wildlife encounters.
- **Tasks:**
  - Install critter-proof casing on all exposed cables.
  - Conduct a comprehensive audit of network infrastructure vulnerabilities.
  - Review and update incident response plans to include wildlife incidents.

## Lessons Learned:
- Squirrels are not to be underestimated. They possess a unique blend of curiosity and destructiveness that can rival the most sophisticated cyber threats.
- Always expect the unexpected. While we prepare for digital threats, we must also consider the vulnerabilities posed by the natural world.
- Humor can be a valuable coping mechanism in the face of unexpected challenges. Embrace the absurdity, learn from it, and move forward.


In conclusion, while our systems may occasionally fall victim to nature's whims, our resilience and ability to adapt ensure that we emerge stronger and wiser. Let's remain vigilant, both in the digital realm and the great outdoors.
